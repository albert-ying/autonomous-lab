Autonomous Lab
Copyright 2025-2026 Albert Ying

This project builds on the following open-source work:

1. The Virtual Lab
   By James Zou Lab, Stanford University, MIT License
   https://github.com/zou-group/virtual-lab
   Swanson et al., "The Virtual Lab of AI agents designs new
   SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies." Nature (2025).

   The concept of a virtual research lab with LLM agents acting
   as PI and scientist roles, iterating through structured meetings,
   is inspired by this work.

2. mcp-feedback-enhanced
   By Minidoracat (2024), MIT License
   https://github.com/Minidoracat/mcp-feedback-enhanced

   The Web UI, feedback loop, session management, and i18n
   infrastructure are derived from this project.

3. interactive-feedback-mcp
   By Fábio Ferreira (2024), MIT License
   https://github.com/fabiomlferreira/interactive-feedback-mcp

   The original MCP feedback server that mcp-feedback-enhanced
   was built upon.

4. biomni
   By Jure Leskovec Lab, Stanford University, Apache 2.0 License
   https://github.com/snap-stanford/Biomni

   The optional biomedical toolkit integration wraps biomni's
   tools and databases. biomni is not bundled; it is installed
   at runtime when the user opts in. Some integrated tools and
   databases within biomni carry their own licenses.

The original MIT-licensed code from (2) and (3) has been
substantially modified, extended, and re-architected for the
Autonomous Lab project (autonomous PI/Trainee loop, editorial
workflow, character system, skill containers, citation engine,
game-style monitoring UI, multi-domain generalization).
