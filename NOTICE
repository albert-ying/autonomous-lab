This project builds on the following open-source work:

1. mcp-feedback-enhanced
   By Minidoracat (2024), MIT License
   https://github.com/Minidoracat/mcp-feedback-enhanced

   The Web UI, feedback loop, session management, and i18n
   infrastructure are derived from this project.

2. interactive-feedback-mcp
   By Fábio Ferreira (2024), MIT License
   https://github.com/fabiomlferreira/interactive-feedback-mcp

   The original MCP feedback server that mcp-feedback-enhanced
   was built upon.

3. BiomNI
   By James Zou Lab, Stanford University, Apache 2.0 License
   https://github.com/snap-stanford/Biomni

   The optional biomedical toolkit integration wraps BiomNI's
   tools and databases. BiomNI is not bundled; it is installed
   at runtime when the user opts in. Some integrated tools and
   databases within BiomNI carry their own licenses.

The original MIT-licensed code from (1) and (2) has been
substantially modified, extended, and re-architected for the
Autonomous Lab project (autonomous PI/Trainee loop, editorial
workflow, character system, skill containers, citation engine,
game-style monitoring UI).
