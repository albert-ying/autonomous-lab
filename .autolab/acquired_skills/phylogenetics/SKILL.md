# Phylogenetics Skill

## When to Use
Use for phylogenetic tree reconstruction from sequence alignments.

## Standard Workflow
1. Align sequences with MUSCLE, MAFFT, or ClustalW
2. Build trees with FastTree, RAxML, or IQ-TREE
3. Visualize and annotate trees

## Key Decisions
- Choose appropriate substitution model
- Use bootstrapping for branch support
- FastTree for speed, RAxML/IQ-TREE for accuracy
