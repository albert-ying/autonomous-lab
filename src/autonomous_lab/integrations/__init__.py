"""
Autonomous Lab — Optional Integrations

Third-party tools that can enhance the lab but are NOT required.
Each integration follows a detect → install → use pattern:
  1. On startup, detect if the tool is installed.
  2. If user opts in, install from source at runtime.
  3. Expose capabilities via the MCP tool layer.

No third-party code is bundled. Everything is fetched live.
